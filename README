ADDING LINKS TO THE MENU 
For adding new links:
1.-Just add the link in the html:
<li><a href="contact2" id="contact2">Contact2</a></li>
The id should be the destination page you want to add.
(The pages are just prettified via .htaccess)

The href will make it SEO-bots compatible.
When navigated by users, the mia.js replaces the href for an # and
creates a click click event that will load via ajax the page indicated
by the id.

2.option a.-Add in the pages.js for the php
... and in pages.json for the mia.js loader to work
You could use a json editor.

2.option b.-Or... just go to the code acms.php and uncomment $contents 
and add the entry to the array. 
Uncomment $this->save_pages_js($contents); in function acms().
Run it once. Comment again so it runs smoother.

OUTPUTS: PHP AND AJAX EXPLANATION
Where the output loaded by ajax goes:
This line at index.php outputs the contents via php for seo bots.
<?php echo $mia->getAjax(); ?>
The contents of the <div id="ajax"> are changed by ajax for that
good user experience when viewed on browsers.
