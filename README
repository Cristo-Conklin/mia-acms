ADDING LINKS TO THE MENU 
To add a new link:

1.-Just add the link in the html:
<li><a href="contact2" id="contact2">Contact2</a></li>
(The id should be the destination page you want to add)

2.-Add the page in the json file acms/page.js 

OUTPUTS: PHP AND AJAX EXPLANATION
(The address pages are just prettified via .htaccess)

The href will make it SEO-bots compatible.
When navigated by users, the mia.js replaces the href for an # and
creates a click click event that will load via ajax the page indicated
by the id.

Where the output loaded by ajax goes:
This line at index.php outputs the contents via php for seo bots.
<?php echo $mia->getAjax(); ?>
The contents of the <div id="ajax"> are changed by ajax for that
good user experience when viewed on browsers.

CONTENTS:
Each section/menu option defined will load its contents from a file
located in the /contents dir, and linked in the cms as stated above.
